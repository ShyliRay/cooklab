# CookLab

**CookLab** is a science-first cooking project where recipes are treated as structured data.
Ingredients are stored in metric units and dynamically scaled by serving size, unit system,
or available ingredient quantities.

The goal is to make cooking more flexible, accurate, and understandable by focusing on
*why* ingredients and techniques work.
